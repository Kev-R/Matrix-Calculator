# Matrix Calculator 

#### Video Demo: 
#### Description: 
This Project is programmed in C and is a Calculator that performs Matrix Calculations.
The main operations this program performs include Scaling, Adding, Subtracting, and Multiplying Matrices. 

This C program is run from the command line. and has to be passed in 2 arguments. 

./Matrix.c <rowLength> <colLength>

Since any operation needs at least 1 matrix, the user can pass in the dimensions of that matrix.
Then the user need to input the operation he wants to do. This is done be typing in either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each Integer correspond to a menu option that is displayed in the terminal.
Then the user is shown a Diagram of the Matrix and prompted to input each element of the array. 

If the operation chosen by the user requires 2 matrices, the user will be prompted to input a second matrix as well. 

Then the operation is performed and the result is displayed to the user. 
The program terminates after this.
